- A VPN Client aimed to only redirect valorant's voice chat traffic to avoid high ping in-game.
- Creates a windows VPN, Relies on rasphone API.
- The project is discontinued since i got banned falsely banned from valorant,
however it's confirmed that it **wasn't** related to VPN usage, the code is far from done and really messy,
so as always use at your own risk.
